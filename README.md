What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  In this course, we analysed different data structures to find which one would run a data base of infomration the fastest. 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  We created programs that would show the runtime for each type of data structure. We also created a run time analyses table for which we entered expected run times via    pseudocode. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  To overcome roadblocks in the project, I used my textbook to refer back to the fundatmentals of what we were doing. I also used external resources such as stack overflow to help with understanding some of the reasoning behind why the code worked. 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  It has opened my eyes to creating a solution with a faster run time and efficency rating instead of just one that works. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Once I make a robust code, I need to do my best to optimize the code to ensure faster processing and a higher efficency.
